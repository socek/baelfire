3.3 Running tasks
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    bael -t some.lib.TaskClass

All tasks runned by bael will generate .baelfire.report file which is a yaml
file with report of what has been runned and why.

3.4 Graphs
----------

There is a possibility to generate graph from task run. Just after task add "-g"
switch.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bael -t tester.taskme3:Example -g

If you forgot the switch, after running task you can generate graph from report
file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bael -r .baelfire.report

Graphs are generated in ``graph.png`` file.
