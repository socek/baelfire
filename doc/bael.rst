3.3 Running tasks
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    bael -t some.lib:TaskClass

``-t`` switch is expecting python dotted url for Task class or function which will return created Task object. Module with
tasks should be in python path. All tasks runned by bael will generate .baelfire.report file which is a yaml file with
report of what has been runned and why.

.. literalinclude:: code/doc12.py
    :language: python
    :caption: doc12.py
    :linenos:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bael -t doc12:run
     * INFO doc12.MyTask: Running *
    hello

3.4 Graphs
----------

``bael`` can create graph from report created from last run. This is very helpful, when you want to debug your tasks.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bael -t doc12:run -g

If you forgot the switch, after running task you can generate graph from report
file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bael -r .baelfire.report

Graphs are generated in ``graph.png`` file. If you would like to use the graph in your code, you should check
``baelfire.application.commands.graph.graph:Graph``.
